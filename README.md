In this project, we will be focusing on analyzing the brain areas and connections of the macaque brain. We will use the dataset macaque from igraphdata package. This dataset is made available for those who are interested in neuroscience and its applications in real life. The macaque brain is often used as a model system for the human brain due to its similarities to humans.
